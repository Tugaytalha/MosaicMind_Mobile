## Setup Guide

**Note:** In its current state, the mobile app needs to be run using `flutter run` or from VSCode GUI. This is because the IP addresses of the Raspberry Pi devices are volatile.
So before running the program, make sure to enter the IP addresses correctly in the `selection.dart` file.

## Running the program

1. **Connect your phone:**
   - Plug your phone into your computer.
   - Ensure USB debugging is enabled on your phone.
   - Grant necessary permissions to your computer.

2. **Run the app:**
   - Choose one of the following options:
     - **Flutter run:** Open a terminal and run `flutter run`.
     - **VSCode:**
       - Open the project in VSCode.
       - Click on the "Run without debugging" button.
